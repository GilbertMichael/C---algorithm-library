C---algorithm-library
=====================

This is a collection of C++ files which efficiently implement various standard algorithms. You
may be wondering, "why not just use the STL libraries?" The truth is, I have absolutely nothing against 
The STL libraries. I just sometimes prefer to use code that I have written and that I understand completely. 
I am also fully confident that these files are efficiently implemented and can be used by anybody that is used
to using the standard libraries. Feel free to give any of these files a try. If you have any questions or comments, 
you can reach me at my email, michael dot james dot gilbert at gmail dot com.
